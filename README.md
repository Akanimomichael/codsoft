# CodSoft Internship Program

Welcome to the CodSoft Internship Program! This repository serves as the central hub for our interns to showcase their skills and collaborate on various projects. As part of this program, interns will work on three exciting projects:

1. **Portfolio Website:** Interns will create their personal portfolio websites to showcase their achievements, skills, and projects they work on during their time with CodSoft. This project allows interns to get hands-on experience with web development technologies.

2. **Todo List Application:** In this project, interns will develop a feature-rich todo list application. It will help them understand the fundamentals of building interactive web applications and user interfaces.

3. **Calculator:** The calculator project is a great opportunity for interns to dive into software development. They will design and implement a calculator application that can perform basic mathematical operations.
